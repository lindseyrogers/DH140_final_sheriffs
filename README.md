## Data and Vis of Interest
### [Using Data to Reduce Police Violence](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/bclr57&i=117)

This article explores the possible implications of the Death in Custory Reporting Act in 2014 as a way to reduce police violence through data analysis. This idea is a main pillar of my current research, which I hope to use skills from this class to continue. Rushin explains that this act makes police violence data public, which alone would not lead to police reform, but with analysis has the potential to change these trends.

### Bused Out: Where America Moves its Homeless
![alt text](https://www.maptive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/distribution-chart.png "Data Visualiation")

This data visualization caught my eye to relplicate because it provides interesting commentary on where homeless people are relocated out of cities, connecting this data to city politics, economic unequality, and migration practices within the United States. This data visualization is originally from an article titled *Bused Out: Where America Moves its Homeless* written in 2017 and published in *The Guardian*.

Humanities topics:
* Social Movements - Thinking about right-wing or left-wing social movements within the United States
* Political Movements and Elections - Extension of my work on Constitutional Sheriffs
* Conflicts and Violence - looking at Empires, Wars, and Police Violence

I am interested in the Data Vizualisation and Web scraping modules on the syllabus. Data visualization is applicable to all of these topics as the data can be visually represented in many ways, such as a map or infographic. The web scrapping module would be usefull for analyzing social movements and political movements as I can web scrape twitter or other sites to quantify language used or interactions between twitter users. 

## Ideas of Data to Investigate
[Big Data, Automated Textual Analysis, and Protest Events](https://mobilizingideas.wordpress.com/2015/03/09/big-data-automated-textual-analysis-and-protest-events/): This article describes how data and web scrapping is being used to analyze protest movements. Using social media posts is proving effective as this type of data is timely, geographic, and abundant. 

[Data Visualization: The Next Political Tool?](https://www.toucantoco.com/en/blog/data-visualization-influencing-election): This very brief article explains how data visualization is becoming increasingly important in the world of politial elections and provides links to examples of this type of data visualization.

[Senseless: Deaths per Hour](https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/senseless-conflict-deaths-per-hour/): This data visualization is a really interesting way to present which global conflicts are the most violence, representing the number of deaths per hour during the conflict. This would also be an interesting graphic to reproduce in the previous question.


## Ideas from Curated Datasets & Project Lists
Dataset Name | Description | Link
:---: | :---: | :---:
Mapping Police Violence | This dataset is not provided in the links above. This is a dataset of police violence in the United States since 2013. I have been using this data last quarter for my research on constitutional sheriffs. I would like to use coding to futher slice the data by year to provide a change over time narrative to my project. | [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/)
Bilateral Trade | This dataset, also not from the links above, provides tabular data on imports and exports between countries. This could make a really interesting map datavisualization of the interactions between countries and looking at the flow of trade. I'm imagining a map of the world filled with linkages of different sizes and colors between countries that represent trade. | [Bilateral Trade](https://data.world/cow/bilateral-trade)
Library Book Aquisitions | This dataset made me think of a book I read last year, *Palaces for the People*, by Eric Klinenberg, which analyzed how libraries provided a safe refuge during the Chicago heat wave. This dataset, paired with other socioeconomic datasets, could be used for similar analysis in the midwest to make a further argument about the benefits of social infrastructure. | [Library Acqusitions](https://cardinalscholar.bsu.edu/handle/123456789/194598)

## Direction for the Final Project
This final project will serves as a continuation of an exploratory research project I began in the Fall using the Mapping Police Violence dataset. Results from this past project show promise for future research, such as an indication of spatial and temporal trends in this data. 

This dataset is a .csv file that has over 10,000 data entries with interesting data collected for each entry. While I am not entirely sure which direction I want to take this final project, I have some ideas:
* Mapping where police and sheriff violence takes place (creating a map in python)
* Analyzing trends of violence over time (seperating the data by year)
* Analyzing language of prominent constitutional sheriffs (This is not using the Mapping Police Violence dataset, but is more of a proof of concept for a methodology I've been thinking about as we go through this class)
